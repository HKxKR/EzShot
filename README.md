# EzShot

//
EzShot is a phone based application that will allow users to screenshot their phone screen with customizing options,
such as choosing block of area to screenshot, drawing pen, note taking function, etc. 

This app will help users to choose certain area to screenshot and save without having to screenshot the whole screen
and editing in the photo album. Plus, the add-on features such as pens and note taking function will add varieties to 
the app as well.
